## Embeddings

An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.

### How to get embeddings
Get a vector representation of a given input that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms.

    POST  https://api.tapsage.com/v1/embeddings
Creates an embedding vector representing the input text.
####  Request body
```bash 
curl https://api.tapsage.com/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TAPSAGE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "The food was delicious and the waiter...",
    "model": "text-embedding-ada-002",
    "encoding_format": "float"
  }'
```
 - **input** string or array | <span style="color:blue">*Required*</span>: Input text to embed, encoded as a string or array of tokens. To embed multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array of strings or array of token arrays. The input must not exceed the max input tokens for the model (8192 tokens for `text-embedding-ada-002`), cannot be an empty string, and any array must be 2048 dimensions or less.
 - **model** string | <span style="color:blue">*Required*</span>: ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see OpenAI's [Model overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them.
 - **encoding_format** string | Optional | Defaults to  float: The format to return the embeddings in. Can be either `float` or [`base64`](https://pypi.org/project/pybase64/).
 - **user** string | Optional: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.

## Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning lets you get more out of the models available through the API by providing:

-   Higher quality results than prompting
-   Ability to train on more examples than can fit in a prompt
-   Token savings due to shorter prompts
-   Lower latency requests

OpenAI's text generation models have been pre-trained on a vast amount of text. To use the models effectively, we include instructions and sometimes several examples in a prompt. Using demonstrations to show how to perform a task is often called "few-shot learning."

Fine-tuning improves on few-shot learning by training on many more examples than can fit in the prompt, letting you achieve better results on a wide number of tasks.  **Once a model has been fine-tuned, you won't need to provide as many examples in the prompt.**  This saves costs and enables lower-latency requests.

At a high level, fine-tuning involves the following steps:

1.  Prepare and upload training data
2.  Train a new fine-tuned model
3.  Evaluate results and go back to step 1 if needed
4.  Use your fine-tuned model
